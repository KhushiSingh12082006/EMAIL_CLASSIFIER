📧 AETHER SCAN – AI-Based Email Security Detection System

An intelligent Email Classification & Security Detection System built using Django + BERT, designed to detect whether an email is SAFE or NON-SAFE, along with identifying the email category such as phishing, promotional, security alert, etc.

This project was developed as part of the IBM Internship / IBM Tecnovate Program.

Model Handling (Important)

 The trained BERT model is NOT included in this GitHub repository
This is intentional to avoid large file issues.
